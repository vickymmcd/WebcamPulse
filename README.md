We are implementing our own version of a fast fourier transform for our final
project in linearity 2 to help us better understand how the fourier transform
works. We are then using this function in a [webcam heart rate monitor program](https://github.com/vickymmcd/HeartMonitor)
to test its functionality and play with an application of what
we have learned.
